      "description": "Countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda\nOrganization: Handicap International - Humanity & Inclusion\nClosing date: 24 Feb 2026\nContract information\nPlace:\nEthiopa/Uganda/Kenya,\nStarting date:\n1st April 2026;\nDuration of contract:\n24 months;\nClosing date for applications:\n24 February 2026.\nHumanity & Inclusion presentation\nHumanity & Inclusion is an independent and impartial aid organisation working in situations of poverty and exclusion, conflict and disaster. The organisation works alongside people with disabilities and vulnerable populations, taking action and bearing witness in order to respond to their essential needs, improve their living conditions and promote respect for their dignity and fundamental rights.\nSince its creation in 1982, HI has run development & humanitarian projects in more than 55 countries and responded to numerous emergencies. Today, we have a budget of approximately 200 million euros, with 4,000 employees worldwide\nAt Handicap International-Humanity & Inclusion, we truly believe in the importance of inclusion and diversity within our organisation. This is why we are engaged to a disability policy to encourage the inclusion and integration of people with disabilities.\nPlease indicate if you require any special accommodation, even at the first interview.\nFor more information about the organisation.\nJOB CONTEXT:\nRegional context\n- East Africa (Ethiopia, Somalia/Somaliland, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan) and later in 2026 possible new countries.\nEast Africa region faces multiple challenges: armed conflicts and insecurity, population displacement (refugees and internally displaced persons), epidemics and public health issues, food insecurity and famine, and various protection incidents. These factors exacerbate the vulnerabilities of people with disabilities and marginalized groups.\nEast Africa is home to approximately 3.8 million refugees, representing 10% of the world's refugees but faces growing challenges in terms of resources and integration.\nOngoing crises in Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia are exacerbating displacement.\nIn this context, Humanity & Inclusion (HI) implements humanitarian and development actions aimed at improving access to essential services, strengthening community resilience, and promoting inclusion. HI's interventions focus on several areas: physical and functional rehabilitation, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), inclusive education (and EI in emergencies), protection, food security and humanitarian mine action (including clearance, victim assistance and risk education). HI's approach is based on community participation, promoting a \u201cdo no harm\u201d policy, and seeking to achieve a lasting impact that promotes human dignity and inclusion in humanitarian action.\nHI has around 350-400 employees in this region, with a budget of \u20ac20 million.\nAs part of its commitment to continuous improvement, HI has embarked on a process of regionalization and decentralization of its operational governance, with the aim of bringing decision-making closer to local realities. This change is accompanied by greater pooling of resources, harmonization of practices, and increased efforts to ensure programmatic consistency across its various areas of intervention. By early 2026, the program teams will work closely and in an integrated manner within a strengthened regional space to maximize the impact, responsiveness, and relevance of actions carried out as close as possible to the populations concerned.\nThe security situation in the region varies from country to country, with some areas affected by tensions or travel restrictions, particularly in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. Appropriate risk management mechanisms are in place to ensure the safety of teams.\nYOUR MISSION:\nUnder the hierarchical supervision of the Technical Head of Program (THOP), and in close collaboration with the Regional Director, Country Managers, Country Directors, country-based business development officers, Operations Managers, shared service managers and other technical Unit members, the Business Development Specialist actively contributes to the development of the East Africa regional program by designing, implementing, and monitoring its fundraising strategy.

Concern operates in some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable and disaster-prone countries, with programs focused on emergency response, health and nutrition, livelihoods, education, and climate resilience. Concern is currently implementing a program in collaboration with Machakos County Government to strengthen the Orange-Fleshed Sweet Potato (OFSP) value chain, with a particular focus on increased OFSP production, value addition and strengthening of market linkages. As part of the initiative, the program seeks to enhance access to certified, drought-tolerant OFSP seed varieties for smallholder farmers within the county. The OFSP variety is a critical crop in addressing food security and nutrition (Vitamin A-Beta Carotine) ensuring the availability of quality planting materials in Machakos County. Orange-Fleshed Sweet potato (OFSP) has a precursor of Vitamin A and has been promoted as a key intervention in addressing micronutrient deficiencies, especially in vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women.\nMachakos County was selected for the project based on a comprehensive assessment of its potential for integration into the OFSP value chain. Key factors considered included (i) proximity to Nairobi, the economic and consumption hub, (ii) a suitable environment for OFSP production, (iii) high agricultural production potential, and (iv) the capacity and demand of the local community. Agriculture employs 75% of the County population. However, the lack of proper farming techniques has resulted in a harvest of less than 10 tons of OFSP per hectare, limiting farmers' income. With the adoption of appropriate agricultural techniques, yields can increase by at least 1.5 times, reaching 15\u201330 tons per hectare. The project, therefore, aims at directly or indirectly mitigating the effects of low agricultural productivity on farmers\u2019 income and reducing high vulnerability to climate change.\nPurpose of the Consultancy\nThe purpose of this consultancy is to provide\nhigh-quality photography and videography services\nthat highlight project activities, community voices, and programme outcomes across all the project sites\nThe consultant will produce:\nStill photographs\nShort videos suitable for social media and reporting\nBrief written profiles of interviewees\nInterview recordings in the language preferred by interviewees\nObjectives and Scope of Work (specific tasks)\nObjectives\nCapture quality visual and audio material that represents the work and impact of the Triple M Project.\nProvide usable content for reporting, visibility, learning, and communication.\nTasks\nLiaise with Concern staff to understand priorities, sites, and target outputs.\nVisit assigned project sites within Machakos County as scheduled.\nCapture:\nHigh-quality photographs\nShort videos (1\u20133 minutes), including interviews and activity footage\nConduct interviews in Kamba, Kiswahili, or English as appropriate.\nPrepare short written profiles of interviewees and caption information for all photos.\nProvide raw files and edited versions of photos and videos.\nEnsure all content is ethically collected and aligned with safeguarding requirements.\nSubmit final outputs within the agreed timeframe.\nOutputs\nThe consultant will deliver:\nA set of\nhigh-resolution photographs\norganised by activity and location.\nA collection of\nshort, edited videos\n(1\u20133 minutes each) suitable for social media and reporting.\nRaw footage and raw photos.\nBrief written profiles of interviewees and captions for all images.\nA short documentation note summarising activities completed.\nEssential and Desirable Qualifications\nEssential\nProven experience in videography and photography for development, humanitarian, or community-focused projects.\nAbility to communicate in Kamba, Kiswahili, and English.\nAbility to conduct interviews in the interviewee\u2019s preferred language.\nCapacity to prepare brief written profiles and captions.\nOwnership and use of professional equipment, including:\nHD camera\nMicrophone for clear audio capture\nAbility to work flexibly and travel to field sites when needed.\nExperience working in similar assignments with NGOs, CBOs, or development agencies.\nAbility to provide a detailed workplan before commencement.\nDesirable\nKnowledge of Machakos County context.\nFamiliarity with humanitarian or development themes.\nExperience producing short social media videos\nPayments\nConcern Worldwide will provide payment upon the successful d",

      "description": "Country: Kenya\nOrganization: FSD Kenya\nClosing date: 18 Feb 2026\nBackground\nFinancial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD Kenya) is an independent trust dedicated to the achievement of a financial system that delivers value for a green and inclusive digital economy while improving financial health and capability for women and micro and small enterprises (MSEs). FSD Kenya works closely with the public sector, the financial services industry, and other partners to develop financial solutions that better address the real-world challenges that low-income households, micro and small enterprises, and underserved groups such as women and youth face. Current FSD Kenya funders are the United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), The Gates Foundation, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). To learn more about our work, refer to our\nwebsite\n.\nThe Green Finance for Youth Employment (GFYE) Project is a four-year Project (\n2024-2027\n) that is funded by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MFA) of Finland in partnership with the National Treasury of Kenya and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Project is aimed at creating decent jobs for the youth in green value chains operating in rural Kenya, specifically by addressing key constraints for private sector financing that is required for effective youth job creation. The intended impact of the Project is for the rural youth to have increased and resilient incomes through green livelihoods, which is to be achieved through scalable green investment models for the youth and access to sustainable financing and investments for youth and rural enterprises that is youth-led or youth-employing. The Project target low-income rural youth aged between 18-35 years involved in both on-farm and off-farm activities in 14 Counties in Kenya, with at least 50% of the targeted youth being women.\nThe 14 target Counties are: Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Embu, Machakos, Nakuru, Kisii, Siaya, Nandi, Kakamega, Busia, Bungoma and Trans Nzoia.\nThe project will be implemented through three inter-related components:\nComponent 1\n: Scalable green business models and products for the youth, with a focus on the identification and classification of existing scalable green business models and targeted financial products for young women and men that operate in the Kenyan food system. A key objective of this component is to provide an evidence base and solid framework for the capacity building and financing components of the project (Component 2-3).\nComponent 2:\nCapacity building for green investments for youth employment, including building the capacity of young women and men and youth-led and youth employing MSMEs to access and effectively use green financing. This Component also includes dedicated capacity building on the supply side, i.e. financial institutions operating in rural areas such as SACCOs and MFBs.\nComponent 3: De-risking for increased green financing to the project target group through a piloting a \u201cYouth Green Loan Product\u201d, to be implemented by the National Treasury.\nFSD Kenya is an implementing partner of the GFYE Project and is responsible for the implementation of Component 1, jointly with other GFYE implementing partners and stakeholders. One of the planned activities under Component 1 is a scoping analysis of commercially viable green and sustainable business models and employment opportunities for the youth, women and persons with disabilities in the 14 target Counties. However, it is not just about identifying viable enterprises but identifying those that are commercially viable and can be financed by participating financial institutions (PFIs) in the GFYE project. As such, the scoping analysis will include an assessment of financial institutions, business and enterprise support organisations that are financing and supporting these businesses.

For those who can safely remain in the country to which they have fled, we help them reach stability and work towards self-reliance so they can meet their own needs. Unfortunately, many refugees can\u2019t go home and can\u2019t safely stay in the country to which they have fled. We help these people relocate to a safe, new country, through resettlement or other pathways so that they can begin to rebuild their lives. RefugePoint helps refugees access these solutions using three tactics: direct services, field building, and systems change. Through this three-pronged approach we provide direct services to thousands of refugees each year, strengthen the capacity of other organizations to better serve refugees, and influence global policy and practice to transform refugee response systems.\nLasting solutions work. Directly, we\u2019ve referred over 140,000 refugees for resettlement or other pathways to a safe, third country. We\u2019ve also equipped thousands of refugees with the tools to support themselves and their families in the country to which they\u2019ve fled. Through innovation, collaboration, and influence, we've helped lead the sector in expanding long-lasting, refugee-centered solutions, and instigated major sea changes in global practice.\nYou will be joining a growing organization (115+ staff globally) that is spearheading new initiatives that are changing the face of humanitarian response, and we would be excited to have you as part of our team!\nOUR VALUES\nRefugePoint has core, cross-cutting principles and values that define our work:\nRefugee-Centered:\nWe create space for and elevate refugee voices and leadership within the organization to guide our work.\nAnti-Racist & Anti-Colonial:\nRecognizing that racism, colonialism, and global white supremacy culture have caused many of the inequities driving the world\u2019s refugee situations, we seek to integrate and center anti-racist and anti-colonialist principles in all that we do.\nEquity-Focused:\nWe deliver services, build capacity, and influence policies and systems to strengthen equity in the humanitarian sector.\nTrauma-Informed:\nWe integrate a trauma-informed approach and offer mental health and psycho-social support services to clients and staff.\nEvidence-Informed Practice:\nWe use an evidence-informed approach to practice, i.e., the integration of research evidence alongside practitioner expertise and the people experiencing the practice.\nCollaborative:\nThe urgency of need and the magnitude of the problem requires shared responsibility and shared action. We seek opportunities to engage in networks and partnerships.\nPOSITION OVERVIEW\nThe Graphic Designer plays a key role in bringing RefugePoint\u2019s mission, impact, and stories to life through compelling, mission-aligned visual design.

      "description": "Country: Kenya\nOrganization: Kakenya\u2019s Dream\nClosing date: 13 Feb 2026\n1. About the organization\nKakenya's Dream is a nonprofit organization that invests in girls from rural communities through education, health, and leadership initiatives. Our programs operate in Transmara, one of the remotest and most marginalized regions of Kenya, where nearly 66% of girls continue to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM) at puberty, 50% are married before the age of 19, and only 17% complete primary education. Kakenya\u2019s Dream has expanded its programs to Kenyenya Sub-County in Kisii County. Girls\u2019 education is not a priority for family or community investment, and social norms perpetuate low educational achievement. Investing in girls\u2019 education yields profoundly positive outcomes not only for the girl, but for her family and community as well.\nOur interconnected programs provide educational opportunities including professional skills development for vulnerable girls and train youth and advocate to the community at large on sexual and reproductive health and rights, provide direct health care services to the surrounding community, and build resilience to climate change in marginalized communities.\na) Education\n: We have two centres for Excellence, Kakenya Centre for Excellence I (KCE I) and Kakenya Centre for Excellence II (KCE II). The two, KCE I and KCE II currently provide safe, and supportive boarding facilities and education to 454 from grade 4 to 12 learners.The program takes a holistic approach to educating girls, incorporating health and leadership elements into the curriculum and providing for all physical and social-emotional needs. We support 185 girls through our Education Access program where they receive mentorship, financial support, and a variety of essential resources to help them succeed in secondary and tertiary education.\nb) Health\n: In the communities we serve, there are several concerns like early child mariages, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), Sexual Violence, teenage preganancies among other harmful practices that needs to be addressed. We have two major programs to address these issues, The Jijue Training, and the Linda Dada campaigns. These programs aim to impact the knowledge, attitude, and practices of our target group on harmful cultural practices. The Jijue program is an out-of-school training where the focus is to train young girls and boys on Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRH). More than 40,000 youths have received training through the Jijue Training. The Linda Dada Program focuses on extending these training to the community through a participatory approach. We have trained over 20,000 youths, parents, and local leaders on fighting harmful practices through the Linda Dada Campaigns. We launched Kakenya Health and Wellness Centre (KHWC), a clinic that serves both girls in our school programs and the community by providing basic healthcare services. The KHWC has served over 21,000 people from the community including learners from our schools.\nc) Economic Empowerment\n: Unemployment remains a big challenge even for those with extensive education qualification in rural Kenya. Kakenya\u2019s Dream helps young women transition from school to securing meaningful employment through robust programs that address the unique challenge of unemployment. We equip them with the relevant skills, networks, and the necessary support they require to succeed in the competitive job market, fostering independence and breaking cycles of dependency.\nd) Climate Resilience\n: As climate changes accelerate, women and young girls in rural Kenya and specifically in Narok and Kisii Counties are exposed to increased risks and challenges that directly impact their health, education and future. We have integrated environmental education into the curriculum in our schools and implemented community-wide conservation and climate resilience initiatives.\ne) Institutional Effectiveness, Growth and Sustainability\n: We ensure that our institutional growth and sustainability enables more girls to access the much needed services and achieve their dreams through the four key areas of our focus. The organization focuses on capacity building of its staff and strengthening our systems to adapt and respond to the dynamic global changes.\n2. Background\nSince 2019, the Kakenya's Dream (KD) has implemented the Jijue training (\"know yourself\" in Swahili) targeting learners in Grade 5,6 and 7. Implemented over three years, the Jijue program aims to foster positive change among in-school adolescent girls and boys by creating awareness of and building self-efficacy to overcome barriers in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and harmful practices (HPs), including child marriage and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). Adolescence is a critical stage when health behaviors are established, patterns of nonfatal disease burden emerge, and risk-taking behaviors are initiated. A large share of the overall health burden among adolescents is attribut",

Founded in 1933 at the call of Albert Einstein, the IRC is one of the world's largest international humanitarian non-governmental organizations (INGO), at work in more than 40 countries and 29 U.S. cities helping people to survive, reclaim control of their future and strengthen their communities. A force for humanity, IRC employees deliver lasting impact by restoring safety, dignity and hope to millions. If you're a solutions-driven, passionate change-maker, come join us in positively impacting the lives of millions of people world-wide for a better future.\nThe IRC opened the country program in South Sudan in 1989.

The crisis has resulted in widespread displacement, severe food insecurity, and a breakdown of essential services, impacting millions of people. The recent crisis in neighbouring Sudan has further exacerbated the situation, leading to an influx of refugees and increased tension along the border, straining already limited resources and worsening humanitarian needs.

      "description": "Country: Uganda\nOrganizations: Chemonics, Famine Early Warning System Network\nClosing date: 17 Feb 2026\nIntroduction\nThe Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) is an integrated set of activities funded by the United States Government (USG) and is intended to provide timely, accurate, evidence-based, and transparent food insecurity early warning information and analysis. Created in 1985 in response to famines in East and West Africa, FEWS NET provides global coverage of acute food insecurity. FEWS NET\u2019s work is implemented across several mechanisms by a team of partners that includes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the University of California-Santa Barbara\u2019s Climate Hazards Center (UCSB-CHC), University of Maryland\u2019s Department of Geographical Sciences, American Institutes for Research (AIR), and Chemonics International (Chemonics). Chemonics implements FEWS NET\u2019s Decision Support Team (DST), which is charged with providing integrated monitoring and analyses of current and forecast acute food insecurity in countries worldwide to support the United States Government\u2019s (USG) policy and programmatic decisions. The DST operates through a Washington-based technical office, regional FEWS NET offices, and national staff presence in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and eastern Europe.\nFEWS NET\u2019s objective is to produce timely, evidence-based decision support to enable the efficient allocation of humanitarian assistance on the basis of need.\nBased on an in-depth understanding of local livelihoods, FEWS NET monitors information and data on factors that affect food security, such as conflict, weather and agroclimatology, crops, pasture, markets and trade, and nutrition. The FEWS NET DST produces regular reports, including Food Security Outlooks and Outlook Updates, emergency alerts, market and price updates, and targeted analyses. FEWS NET makes reports available at\nwww.fews.net\nand distributes them globally to governments, relief agencies, and other organizations engaged in humanitarian response and development programs.\nThe eighth phase of FEWS NET began in 2024. The work of the FEWS NET DST relies on close collaboration with international, regional, and national partners on food security-related data and information gathering and analysis. Major activities include joint monitoring and assessments, data sharing and exchanges, collaborative analysis and reporting, and support of local and regional food security networks.\nPosition Description\nThe FEWS NET DST maintains virtual and physical field offices in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Five regional offices coordinate and oversee the technical and administrative management of over 40 country offices. Each country office falls into one of three tiers, depending on the complexity of the context and operating environment. Tier 1 countries require a larger staffing footprint, while Tier 3 countries require a smaller one. There are four main technical positions at the country level: Country Technical Lead (CTL); Country Technical Manager (CTM); Country Technical Senior Specialist for Food Security (CTSS-FS); and Country Technical Senior Specialist for Conflict (CTSS-C).\nThe CTSS-C will be responsible for providing an assessment of conflict and violence dynamics in support of food security analysis. The CTSS-C, under the direction and guidance of the CTL and the Regional Technical Senior Specialist\u2013Conflict (RTSS-C), who work in close alignment with the home office-based Security & Conflict Advisor, is responsible for supporting the following activities, in collaboration with other technical staff in the country:\nProviding efficient monitoring, assessment, and early warning analysis as it pertains to conflict, food security, and conflicts\u2019 impacts on food insecurity.

Our work focuses on improving the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of AGYW in Sub-Saharan Africa, addressing the \u201cTriple Threat\u201d of early pregnancy, HIV, and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).\nIn Uganda, Tiko partners with private franchised and non-franchised health facilities, Public health facilities, and Local government authorities (Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) and Wakiso). Through these partnerships, Tiko ensures AGYW have access to high-quality HIV, SRH, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV), and mental health services supported by high-quality and verifiable data. The Tiko platform (accessible via SMS, WhatsApp, Tiko cards for AGYW, and a light Android app for mobilizers and providers) enables real-time data collection and program management.\nMaintaining the integrity and reliability of programmatic data is critical for evidence-based decision-making, regulatory reporting, and service delivery.\nScope of Work\nTiko Africa seeks a qualified consultant to conduct routine, systematic Data Quality Audits (RDQAs) and facilitate Strategic Data Review Sessions at Tiko-supported health facilities in Kampala and Wakiso.\nCoordination and Joint DQA Participation: Working closely with Tiko, the consultant will support coordination with the local government authorities (KCCA and Wakiso District) to facilitate and participate in joint on-site RDQA activities.\nOn-Site RDQA Execution: Conduct full on-site RDQA processes, including data extraction, tallying, and comparative verification between services reported on the Tiko platform and official primary source registers (HMIS).\nDocument key process observations, facility capacity gaps, and the condition of health records at the facilities visited. The RDQA must also include documentation of broader contextual factors (e.g., donor funding shifts or new health policies) that could impact data quality or service delivery.\nRoot cause analysis and action planning: Identify the root causes of discrepancies (e.g., staff attitude, stock-outs, misunderstanding of the Tiko app, transcription errors, or intentional data falsification). Findings must be triangulated, and observations and corrective action points must be developed collaboratively with facility staff.\nReporting: Submit compiled raw data and clean datasets, along with a detailed Comparative Checks Report documenting all variances, root causes, and recommended corrective actions.\nFollow-Up: Conduct structured post-RDQA follow-ups to ensure all action points have been addressed before the next audit cycle.\nSupport for Facility Data Review Sessions: The consultant will support Tiko in executing quarterly Facility Data Review Sessions, which focus on strategic performance deep-dives. These sessions will involve facility in-charges, providers, data personnel, mobilizers (YAPs \u2013 Young Adolescent Peer Supporters), and Tiko staff, to foster ownership and close the data-use feedback loop. The consultant will present performance trends (before/after analysis), demand generation trends, and Quality Assurance (QA) findings, explicitly linking data discrepancies to the Facility Improvement Plan (FIP) to highlight potential financial and reputational implications. Each session will cover the previous six months\u2019 performance and track progress on agreed strategic goals.\nObjectives of the Routine Data Quality Audits (RDQAs)\nRigorously verify the accuracy of reported data against national HMIS tools and data.\nLeverage Facility Data Review Sessions to go beyond compliance, identify gaps, and drive continuous performance improvements.\nEnsure that all previous action points are fully addressed before the start of each new audit cycle.\nMethodology\nQuantitative: Physical verification of registers and service counts using RDQA tools.\nData Triangulation (System Cross-Referencing): Conducting a three-way comparison of data points to ensure consistency across all reporting levels: Tiko Platform Data, Facility Source Documents (Primary Registers), National Health Information System (DHIS2)\nQualitative: Root cause analysis interviews.\nFollow-up and gap closure: Ensure that issues from previous RDQAs have been addressed and gaps closed\nParticipatory: Facilitation of Facility Data Review Sessions to discuss findings and demand generation trends without conducting new service counts.\nDeliverables\nThe timelines below reflect the monthly operational cycle for Q1 2026 and subsequent quarters.\nActivity:\nProject Inception.\nTime Frame:\nBy Mar 13, 2026.\nDeliverable:\nInception Report (.ppt slide deck) including team structure, work plan, risk matrix, and a specific strategy for engaging KCCA/Wakiso officials.\nActivity:\nMonthly RDQAs & Follow-ups.\nTime Frame:\nBy the 25th of every month.\n",

Driven by Christian values, we seek out and work with the most marginalised in society, irrespective of race, gender, age or religion, recognising the equal worth of every individual. Drawing on over 100 years\u2019 experience and world-leading expertise in disability-inclusive development and humanitarian action, inclusive eye health, mental health and psychosocial disabilities, CBM Global works with partners to break the cycle of poverty and disability, treat and prevent conditions that lead to disability and build inclusive communities.\nVision\n: An inclusive world in which all people with disabilities enjoy their human rights and achieve their full potential.\nMission\n: Fighting to end the cycle of poverty and disability.\nCBM Global works to implement development and humanitarian projects in partnership with organisations of persons with disabilities in the areas of Inclusive Development, Humanitarian Action, Inclusive Eye Health & Neglected Tropical Diseases and Mental Health & Psychosocial Disabilities.

The project has been under implementation from July 2023 to March 2026 in Kajiado West Sub-County, Kenya, covering the wards of Keekonyokie, Magadi, Iloodokilani, Ewuaso Oo Nkidong\u2019i, and Mosiro.\nThe project builds on CBM Global\u2019s long-standing engagement with NONDO and responds to persistent exclusion of persons with disabilities in pastoralist and nomadic contexts. Kajiado West has historically experienced marginalisation in development planning, weak Organisations of Persons with Disabilities (OPD) coordination, limited representation of persons with disabilities in decision-making spaces, and low access to sustainable livelihoods. These challenges are compounded by harmful cultural beliefs, gender inequality, climate vulnerability, and limited technical and organisational capacity among grassroots OPDs.\nThe A4C project adopts an Inclusive Development and Social Action for Change approach, aiming to strengthen a vibrant and resilient OPD movement capable of influencing inclusive development, policies, and resource allocation at community and county levels. The project integrates OPD capacity strengthening, advocacy and movement building, inclusive media engagement, livelihood support, and institutional strengthening of the implementing partner.\nThe\noverall objective\nof the project is to increase meaningful participation and representation of persons with disabilities in decision-making processes to promote disability inclusion in development in Kajiado West Sub-County.\nThe project has\nthree\nresult areas:\nEmpowered communities of persons with disabilities\nmeaningfully engaging in development processes.\nA vibrant and resilient OPD movement\nleading change for inclusive communities.\nStrengthened organisational capacity of NONDO\nfor quality and sustainable programme delivery.\nAs the project approaches completion, CBM Global seeks to commission an\nend-term evaluation\nto assess project performance, outcomes, contribution to change, and to generate lessons to inform future CBM Global advocacy, CBID, and OPD-strengthening programming.\n2.

The project is due to end in March 2026. The project is implemented Isiolo North and Merti South sub counties, with cross border outreaches reaching residents from the neighbouring sub counties/counties.\nThe project drew learnings from a previous inclusive eye health and NTD project in Meru County, where cross border movement hampered interventions in Meru County as people migrate periodically across the border from Isiolo. As a result, targeting the neighbouring Isiolo county remained a key strategy towards promoting and securing better eye health in the region.\nThe Project aims to reduce preventable blindness and WASH-related diseases while promoting inclusion for persons with disabilities. Key interventions include inclusive eye health services through school and community screenings, treatment, and surgical outreaches; improved WASH practices via CLTS and school-based behaviour change campaigns; policy advocacy for disability inclusion; and economic empowerment for households of persons with disabilities through SILC training and livelihood support. The project aligns with CBM Global\u2019s strategy, the National Eye Health Strategy, and UNCRPD Article 25, ensuring comprehensive, people-centred, and inclusive health services for marginalized communities.\nThe main objective of the project is to contribute towards reduction in the burden of preventable blindness and diseases related to WASH in Isiolo County.\nThe project has 4 expected results.\nImproved Inclusive Eye Health, accessible to all\nImproved knowledge, attitude, and practices on WASH in Isiolo communities\nPartnership between OPDs and County Government reflected in health-related policies & implementation.\nStrengthened economic development and resilience for households of persons with disability\n2.

The review will also address underlying causes and issues contributing to targets not adequately achieved.\nThe evaluation will examine how input variables such as health services (inclusive eye care screenings, treatments, and surgical outreaches), accessible WASH facilities and practices, CLTS initiatives, livelihood investments (including SILC training and support), and advocacy efforts contribute to outcome variables, including a lower disease burden from preventable blindness and WASH-related diseases, a healthier population, and increased resilience of households of persons with disabilities.\nThe evaluation will generate key lessons in factors that contribute to or prevent access to inclusive person centred eye care services in Isiolo Cou",

Established in 1986 as a technical capacity-building center, ADPC has grown and expanded its role to serve scientific, educational, developmental, and humanitarian purposes. ADPC employs a wide range of professional expertise typically required for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Resilience (CR).\nADPC develops and implements cross-sectoral projects/programs on the strategic themes of Risk Knowledge and Geoinformatics, Policy and Institutional System, Effective Localization for Resilience, Climate Services, Resilient Planning and Implementation, Preparedness and Anticipatory Action, Nature based Solutions, Financing for Resilience, Resilient Recovery, Food and Water Security, Disaster Risk Finance Insurance, Health Risk Management, Urban & Infrastructure Resilience, Private Sector Engagement, and ADPC Knowledge Academy. Our strategic themes are complemented and underpinned by the cross-cutting themes of gender equality and social inclusion, disaster and climate innovations, and regional and transboundary cooperation. In addition to the specialized thematic departments, ADPC addresses three cross-cutting themes through permanent working committees: Gender and Diversity, Poverty and Livelihoods, and Regional and Transboundary Cooperation. Through its work, ADPC supports the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the New Urban Agenda, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the agenda defined at the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, and other relevant international frameworks.\nFor details, please refer to the ADPC website at\nhttp://www.adpc.net/\n.\nB. Department Introduction:\nThe Preparedness and Climate Action (PCA) Department of ADPC focuses on enhancing the preparedness, climate action, and adaptation capacities of governments, response organizations, volunteers, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, communities, and other traditional and non-traditional actors within the Disaster Risk Management and Climate Resilience Ecosystem. It emphasizes the importance of locally-led adaptation strategies as a critical component of effective climate action while striving to strengthen the capacity of institutions and at-risk communities to achieve faster, more efficient, and climate-resilient disaster recovery. The department collaborates with these actors to ensure that regional, national, sub-national, and local disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and climate action frameworks and implementation plans are developed and implemented well before disaster strikes, prioritizing climate resilience and integrating strategies to reduce risks and build resilience against future climate-related hazards.\nC. Statement of Intent\nThe Preparedness and Climate Action (PCA) Department of the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC), in partnership with the Ethiopian Disaster Risk Management Commission (EDRMC), is implementing the program Enhancing Multi-Hazard Preparedness, Early Warning, and Response in Ethiopia (EMPOWER), with technical and financial support from the Gates Foundation. The program aims to strengthen the organizational, institutional, and leadership capacities of Ethiopia\u2019s disaster risk management institutions at both national and sub-national levels. EMPOWER is anchored in the Multi-Hazard Impact-Based Early Warning and Early Action System (MH-IB-EW-EAS) Roadmap developed by EDRMC and officially endorsed by the Government of Ethiopia. Through this roadmap, the program seeks to position EDRMC as a strategic leader,and facilitator within Ethiopia\u2019s disaster risk management ecosystem, supporting more risk-informed, coordinated, and effective preparedness and response systems. Effective coordination across sectors and administrative levels is essential to the successful implementation of the Roadmap.\nIn this context, the objective of the consultancy is to develop a consultative Advocacy and Outreach Strategy for the MH-IB-EW-EAS Roadmap that strengthens stakeholder engagement, raises awareness of multi-hazard early warning systems, and promotes the adoption of MH-IB-EW-EAS as a scalable and nationally owned model for disaster risk management coordination, in alignment with EMPOWER program\u2019s intended outcomes.\nD.

      "description": "Country: Kenya\nOrganization: FSD Kenya\nClosing date: 20 Feb 2026\nBACKGROUND\nFinancial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD Kenya) is an independent trust dedicated to the achievement of a financial system that delivers value for a green and inclusive digital economy while improving financial health and capability for women and micro and small enterprises (MSEs). FSD Kenya works closely with the public sector, the financial services industry, and other partners to develop financial solutions that better address the real-world challenges low-income households, micro and small enterprises, and underserved groups such as women and youth face. Current FSD Kenya funders include the United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), The Gates Foundation, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the French Development Agency (AFD).\nThe Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) was established in 1969 by an Act of Parliament (the Agricultural Finance Corporation Act (Cap 323 Laws of Kenya) to provide affordable credit to actors in Kenya\u2019s agricultural value chains. The specific objective and mandate as set out in the Act is to \u2018\u2019assist in the development of agriculture and agricultural industries by making loans to farmers, cooperative societies, incorporated group representatives, private companies, public bodies, local authorities and other persons engaging in agriculture or agricultural industries\u2019\u2019. With a network spread across the country, AFC\u2019s current mission is to provide sustainable financing though participative and collaborative financial and non-financial interventions, innovations, technology and products.\nIn the recent past, AFC has undergone a strategic refocusing with the objective of transforming into a sustainable and impactful market maker in Kenya\u2019s agricultural finance market. Part of this transformation has included a shift in its operating model to incorporate wholesale financing as one of its business models, adding on to its existing retail lending model. Under its wholesale financing model, AFC provides wholesale funds to SACCOs, microfinance institutions and anchor clients that in turn finance unserved and underserved segments in the agricultural value chains. In addition to wholesale financing, AFC has also implemented other new business models including warehouse receipt financing, mechanization financing and the provision of credit guarantees to de-risk agricultural enterprises.\nIn recognition of its transformation, AFC was selected as the apex institution to implement the Green Finance Facility (GFF) under the Rural Kenya Financial Inclusion Facility (RK-FINFA) Project. RK-FINFA is a six-year development project financed jointly by the IFAD and the Government of Kenya to support the transformation of rural and smallholder agriculture through private sector-led development by improving access to affordable and appropriate financial services by smallholder farmers and micro, small and medium enterprises. The GFF is established as a facility to provide wholesale capital to rural oriented SACCOs, microfinance banks (MFBs) and microfinance institutions for on-lending to smallholder farmers and rural micro enterprises for financing activities and projects in climate change adaptation and mitigation, improved environmental management and improved efficiencies in the use of natural resources. AFC\u2019s allocation under the GFF is KShs 1.080bn with three Microfinance Banks and five SACCOs already contracted for wholesale financing for on-lending to retail borrowers.\nAFC\u2019s role under the GFF is pivotal to address two key interrelated challenges. First, Kenya\u2019s agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to climate change and climate variability. The dependence on rain-fed agriculture and the occurrence of extreme weather events including flooding and drought have significantly impacted production and productivity, with direct effects on Kenya\u2019s food security and cascading effect on the economy. At the same time, the agricultural sector has an important impact on land use and land cover including deforestation and forest degradation as large swathes of land are cleared and converted into farmland. Second, while finance plays a pivotal role in greening Kenya\u2019s economic growth and has been identified as a critical enabler for climate change mitigation and adaptation, the financing of green investments remains limited due to several factors. By one measure, Kenya\u2019s total annual financing gap is estimated at USD 5.13bn. Further downstream, survey data shows that households\u2019 access to formal finance for green investments remain low.\nDiscussions with key potential wholesale borrowers of the GFF indicate strong demand for capital for innovative green investments. Leading financial institutions consider green financing as a key strategy in their future operations, and some are already offering green products to their c",

      "description": "Country: South Sudan\nOrganization: International Rescue Committee\nClosing date: 9 Mar 2026\nThe IRC has been operating in South Sudan since 1989 and is registered as an international NGO. IRC currently delivers multi sectoral programming directly and through partners across seven states and two administrative areas. These include Northern Bahr el Ghazal, covering Aweil East, Aweil West, and Aweil South counties, Unity State, covering Rubkona, Koch, and Panyijiar counties, Upper Nile State, covering Maban, Renk, Panyikang, Nasir, Ulang, and Panylgang counties, Lakes State, covering Rumbek Centre, Rumbek East, and Yirol West counties, Central Equatoria, covering Juba, Yei, and Kajokeji counties, Eastern Equatoria, covering Kapoeta East, Jonglei, covering Ayod, Twic East, Uror, Akobo counties, as well as Abyei Administrative Area and Ruweng Administrative Area, including Pariang County and Ajoung Thok and Pamir refugee camps.\nBackground and objectives of Education for all South Sudan(EFASS)\nSouth Sudan has one of the world's most fragile education systems, with approximately 2.8 to 3 million children, representing around 60 to 70 percent of the school-age population, out of school. Foundational literacy and numeracy outcomes remain critically low, with less than 10 percent of children achieving minimum reading competency. Years of conflict, accelerating climate shocks, and government education expenditure under 3 percent of the national budget have created an entrenched crisis. Girls and children with disabilities are disproportionately affected by these barriers, with harmful gender norms and stigma further limiting their access to education.\nEFASS is a \u00a327 million, four-year programme (April 2026 to March 2030), designed to deliver five interlinked outcomes. These include improving access, retention, and progression for the most marginalised out-of-school children, particularly girls and children with disabilities in conflict and climate-affected areas. The programme also targets improved foundational learning outcomes in literacy and numeracy, strengthened delivery of inclusive and climate-adaptive education approaches by teachers and facilitators, improved education data and evidence for decision-making through a national Learning Outcomes and Quality Assessment, as well as strengthened pathways for system uptake and sustainability beyond EFASS.\nScope of Work\nThe CASH Transfers Lead will serve as the technical lead for all Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) activities under EFASS, overseeing the design, implementation, management, and continuous improvement of cash transfer delivery at scale across South Sudan. This senior technical position requires expertise in managing large-scale cash transfer programmes in fragile and conflict-affected contexts, with a strong focus on ensuring Value for Money (VfM), fiduciary risk management, safeguarding, and adaptive programme management.\nThis role requires overseeing the complete end-to-end cash delivery process, from beneficiary identification and registration through to payment distribution and post-distribution monitoring. This includes managing complex relationships with financial service providers, banks, payment agents, and implementing partners , while coordinating closely with Government of South Sudan counterparts, the Ministry of General Education and Instruction, and key stakeholders. A central aspect of this role involves comprehensive risk management and safeguarding in challenging operating environments.\nThe position requires exceptional strategic leadership and adaptive programme delivery, ensuring that FCDO's investment achieves maximum impact while protecting public funds in a high-risk environment. This involves making evidence-based decisions about scaling transfers up or down in response to changing needs, climate shocks, displacement, or budget adjustments, while exploring and piloting innovative approaches such as anticipatory action triggers linked to climate events. The role demands strong analytical capabilities to generate learning from programme implementation, contribute to the global evidence base on cash transfers in fragile contexts, monitor gender parity and disability inclusion indicators to inform targeting decisions, and work within an adaptive management framework that allows for course correction based on monitoring data and emerging contextual realities in South Sudan's complex and fluid operating environment.\nCASH Leads Responsibilities\nLead the strategic design and implementation of nationwide cash transfer interventions targeting girls and children with disabilities\nDevelop and maintain a clear, feasible end-to-end process for timely and secure delivery of cash transfers across all states\nDesign and oversee robust mechanisms for identifying eligible beneficiaries using Washington Group Questions\nEnsure cash transfer strategies integrate with behaviour change communication (BCC) activities and align with evidence of effective p",

Cumulatively, over 45 million disaster displacements have been recorded in the continent since 2009, with floods accounting for more than 75% of all disaster-related movements. In several regions across the continent climate extremes also intersect with conflict, fragility, and livelihood loss to exacerbate mobility. Displacement not only creates immediate humanitarian needs but can also hinder or reverse development gains for affected individuals, communities, and countries. This underscores the urgent need to address displacement and other forms of mobility through an integrated approach, preventing its occurrence by investing in hazard prevention, mitigation and climate change adaptation, preparing for more effective responses when displacement takes place, and addressing its protracted and long-term impacts by achieving durable solutions, recovery and sustainable development.\nIn response to these trends, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) launched an initiative, aiming to increase understanding of current and future impacts of climate change and natural hazards, especially as it relates to migration and displacement. As part of this vision, and utilising improved data and forecasts, IOM and its partners will support governments and communities to increase the resilience of populations most likely to be impacted by climate-induced displacement and putting in place measures to enhance prevention, preparedness, and reduce or address non-economic loss and damage.\nNotably, IOM established its Climate Mobility Innovation Lab (CMIL) to promote evidence-based solutions to the challenges posed by climate change and human mobility globally, and more specifically in the African continent. As part of these efforts, and under the direct supervision of Head, Climate Mobility Innovation Lab for Africa, IOM is seeking a National Project Officer to help support day to day operations of CMIL Africa and implementation of the CMIL programming such as the Risk Index for Climate Displacement (RICD) as well as the rollout of the Climate Catalytic Fund (CCF) and related innovative responses to climate change and human mobility in Africa. RICD is a decision support tool that allows to identify critical displacement hotspots in countries, while the CCF is a facility that mobilises small, fast, match-funded grants that supports locally-led adaptation, risk reduction and preparedness projects.\nThe role will include supporting on day-to-day project management tasks related to RICD and CCF implementation, driving internal and external communication, as well as liaise with IOM country offices involved in the CMIL work. In addition the incumbent will coordinate and work with IOM partners including universities, research institutions, technical experts, local authorities, and community-based operational actors, contributing to the development of methodologies, and liaising with internal support functions including procurement, HR, finance, etc. IOM is part of the United Nations (UN) System as the leading inter-governmental organization promoting since 1951 humane and orderly migration for the benefit of all, with 174 member states and a presence in over 100 countries.\nResponsibilities\nSupport the day-to-day management and implementation of CMIL Africa projects, ensuring activities are delivered on time, within scope, and aligned with IOM and donor requirements.\nWork with ICPAC and other CMIL key partners to support the planning, organization, and execution of the 1st Regional CMIL Climate Mobility Symposium in March 2026, including:\nLiaising with the IOM event team in Nairobi to arrange venue, visa, transportation and logistical arrangements for all participants;\nIn collaboration with IOM\u2019s RO and ICPAC, finalising the event programme and agenda, by identifying topics and speakers for both the policy and technical segments of the Symposium;\nSupporting the development of presentation materials such as slide decks, presentation materials & talking points for the Symposium;\nDrafting the Symposium report and other related materials; and\nDuring the symposium, managing participation of speakers and attendees, logistics, moderation and any other duty that might be required to ensure a smooth, productive event.\nContribute to the operational rollout of the Climate Catalytic Fund (CCF) in collaborat",

Its vision is \u201cAccelerating Peace by disrupting the cycle of violence\u201d and its mission is \u201cDriving Generational Change for The Hardest Hit by Investing in The Power of Local Communities.\u201d Since being founded in 1999, War Child Canada has worked in 20 countries across the world, and we are currently operational in Afghanistan, Yemen, Sudan, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Uganda.\nWar Child Canada has been operating in refugee hosting districts in Uganda since 2005. War Child Canada is registered as an international non-governmental organization (INGO) and holds a registration as a law firm in Uganda. War Child Canada is currently implementing education, protection, and livelihood projects in ten refugee hosting districts in Uganda (Adjumani, Koboko, Madi Okollo, Terego, Yumbe, Obongi, Isingiro, Kikube, Kamwenge and Lamwo).\nBridge Project Summary:\nBridge project is a 5-year initiative aimed at addressing youth unemployment in 9 refugee hosting districts of Uganda. The project is part of the Mastercard Foundation's Young Africa Works Strategy, which seeks to provide young people with education and training to enable them to secure dignified and fulfilling work. The Bridge project is implemented in partnership with Community Empowerment for Rural Development (CEFORD), Education Local Expertise Uganda (ELECU), and eight refugee-led community-based organizations.\nThe 5-year BRIDGE project (2022 to 2027) is part of the Mastercard Foundation\u2019s Young Africa Works Strategy (2018 to 2030) to address the youth unemployment challenge among refugee and host communities in 9 refugee hosting districts of Adjumani, Obongi, Isingiro, Kamwenge, Kikuube, Yumbe, Terego, Madi Okollo and Koboko districts.\nThe project will be achieved through two outcomes namely:\nIncreased access to market relevant secondary and tertiary education and skills for refugee and host community youth\nImproved capacity of education institutions and teachers to offer quality and relevant education and skills for refugee and host community youth.\nBRIDGE \u2019s overarching program goal is to improve access to quality & relevant education and skills for 73,439 refugee / host community youth and transition 38,912 refugee / host community youth to dignified and fulfilling work in Uganda by 2027.\nConsultancy summary \u2013 Community Score Card methodology:\nThe Community Score Card (CSC) is a participatory social accountability tool that enables communities particularly refugee and marginalized groups to engage constructively with service providers and duty bearers to improve the quality, accessibility, and accountability of education services. Through community scoring, service provider self-assessment, and interface dialogue, the CSC generates evidence-based feedback, strengthens trust, and supports joint action for sustainable education outcomes. The methodology combines community-generated scorecards and service provider self-assessments, followed by interface meetings that foster mutual understanding, problem-solving, and joint action planning. The CSC process strengthens local ownership, enhances trust between communities and duty bearers, and supports sustainable improvements in education outcomes. In refugee-hosting contexts, CSC is particularly relevant for amplifying community voice, strengthening social cohesion, and influencing education system responsiveness.\nTo this end, War Child Canada seeks to engage a qualified consultant or consultancy firm to deliver a four-day CSC training for Refugee-Led Organizations (RLOs) and War Child Canada staff, and to provide technical support for CSC implementation across nine refugee-hosting districts. The consultancy will strengthen participants\u2019 capacity to apply the CSC methodology in the education sector as a tool for advocacy and systems strengthening. The assignment includes a practical training and a one-day simulation exercise to ensure participants are adequately prepared to independently facilitate CSC processes and translate findings into effective, evidence-based advocacy at local and sub-national levels.\nPurpose of this consultancy:\nThe purpose of the Community Score Card (CSC) training is to strengthen the capacity of Refugee-Led Organizations (RLOs) and War Child Canad",

      "description": "Country: Ethiopia\nOrganization: Tiko\nClosing date: 23 Feb 2026\nBackground and Context\nTiko is a non-profit organisation that leverages digital platforms and behavioural insights to improve access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH), HIV, mental health, and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) services for adolescents and young people (AYP) aged 15\u201324 years. In Ethiopia, Tiko applies an ecosystem implementation approach, working with health facilities, community actors, referral partners, and policy stakeholders to reduce barriers to care and improve service quality for vulnerable populations.\nAs part of its SGBV programming, Tiko supports survivors to access a complex set of interlinked services, including biomedical care at health facilities, police services, legal aid, shelter accommodation, and psychosocial support. Survivors may access these services sequentially or concurrently and often experience repeated interactions across multiple service points over time. This makes the SGBV survivor journey particularly complex, with significant risk of attrition, re-traumatisation, and inequitable access to quality care.\nTo strengthen survivor-centred service delivery, Tiko is implementing a mixed-methods SGBV feedback study to systematically document survivor experiences, service quality, referral effectiveness, and provider capacity gaps across the SGBV response ecosystem. The study is guided by an approved research protocol and is designed to generate actionable evidence to inform continuous quality improvement, provider capacity strengthening, and system-level adaptations.\nThis Request for Proposals (RFP) invites qualified individual consultants to provide technical leadership and implementation support for the Ethiopia SGBV Feedback Study, in line with the approved study protocol.\nPurpose of the Assignment\nThe primary purpose of this assignment is to lead the implementation of a rolling SGBV feedback study that assesses the accessibility, quality, safety, and coordination of SGBV services for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) survivors aged 15\u201324 years in Ethiopia Specifically In Addis Ababa.\nThe consultant will be responsible for ensuring high-quality, trauma-informed data collection; adherence to ethical and safeguarding standards; rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis; and timely reporting of actionable findings to inform programme improvement.\nStudy Objectives and Key Evaluation Questions\n1.General Objective\nTo assess the accessibility, quality, and coordination of health and referral services for adolescent survivors of SGBV, in order to inform survivor-centred, safe, and effective service delivery.\n2.

      "description": "Country: Kenya\nOrganization: GROOTS Kenya\nClosing date: 20 Feb 2026\nBackground\nThe Regenerative Seascapes for People, Climate, and Nature (ReSea) project is a multi-country initiative implemented across Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar, and Comoros. The project aims to regenerate coastal and marine ecosystems, strengthen climate resilience, promote inclusive governance, and advance sustainable blue economy opportunities for coastal communities through gender-responsive and nature-based approaches.\nSupported financially by Global Affairs Canada and led regionally by Mission Inclusion in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), ReSea is implemented in partnership with local women\u2019s rights organizations, civil society groups, community networks, research institutions, and government agencies. In Kenya, the project is implemented in Kilifi County, where GROOTS Kenya serves as the Feminist Organization partner responsible for strengthening Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI), fostering community leadership, gender responsive Nature Based Solutions, and supporting women-led climate and marine governance.\nReSea adopts an integrated programming model that includes:\nGender-responsive and inclusive governance of marine and coastal resources\nNature-based solutions (NbS) such as mangrove restoration. Women and youth-led blue economy entrepreneurship incubation\nStrengthening of community structures, including BMUs, CFAs, and grassroots movement-building\nClimate risk awareness and adaptation support\nThis approach recognizes that women and youth are not only disproportionately affected by climate and environmental degradation but are also central to sustainable restoration and economic transformation in coastal landscapes.\nLocal Context and Need for Policy Analysis\nAcross Kilifi, communities depend heavily on marine ecosystems for fishing, mangrove restoration, eco-tourism, marine litter management, and small-scale trade. However, evidence gathered through capacity needs assessment, outcome harvesting, and Key Informant Interviews under the ReSea project highlights widespread challenges, including:\nIncreased climate variability has prolonged droughts, ocean warming, and unpredictable rainfall\nDeclining fish stocks and degradation of marine habitats\nBarriers to accessing fishing licenses, equipment, markets, and climate information\nDominance of male-controlled value chains and exploitative practices (e.g., \u201csex-for-fish\u201d)\nRestrictive cultural and religious norms limit women\u2019s mobility and participation\nWeak enforcement of environmental and fisheries policies\nLow representation of women and youth in marine governance structures\nDespite the existence of multiple policy frameworks governing fisheries, the blue economy, environmental management, and climate resilience, these frameworks often lack gender responsiveness, intersectionality, and community-grounded implementation.\nThe ReSea project, therefore, requires a comprehensive, actionable, gender-responsive policy analysis to guide programming, capacity strengthening, and advocacy across local and national stakeholders.\n2. Purpose of the Assignment\nThe purpose of this consultancy is to conduct a gender-responsive, intersectional, and inclusive policy analysis of the environmental management, climate change adaptation, and blue economy sectors in Kenya\u2014specifically focusing on Kilifi.\nThe analysis will inform ReSea\u2019s advocacy, training, governance strengthening, and entrepreneurship support to ensure women, youth, and marginalized communities can effectively participate in, benefit from, and shape sustainable coastal and marine development.\n3. Scope of Work\nThe consultant will undertake the following core tasks:\nA. Policy Mapping & Review\nIdentify, compile, and analyze existing policies, legal frameworks, strategies, and regulations relevant to:\nMarine and coastal resource governance\nFisheries management (including BMU Regulations and Fisheries Act)\nMarine conservation (MPAs, LMMAs)\nEnvironmental protection and natural resource management\nClimate change adaptation and resilience\nBlue economy development\nGender equality, youth empowerment, and social inclusion\nOutputs:\nAnnotated inventory of policies reviewed\nA matrix showing mandates, gaps, overlaps, and relevance to women, youth, Persons with disabilities, marginalized, and indigenous coastal communities.\nB. GESI Responsiveness Assessment\nAssess the degree to which these policy frameworks:\nRecognize the differential vulnerabilities of women, youth, and marginalized groups\nAddress barriers to resource access, licensing, benefit sharing, decision-making, ownership, and markets\nConsider unpaid care work, safety concerns, GBV risks, and social norms\nSupport equitable participation in governance structures at both local and national levels, such as BMUs and CFAs\nRespond to climate impacts documented through ReSea community consultations\nIntegrate intersectionality, gender-disaggr",

      "organization": "World Vision",
      "location": "Somalia",
      "description": "Country: Somalia\nOrganization: World Vision\nClosing date: 22 Feb 2026\nBackground and Context\nAgropastoral communities in Somaliland face increasing pressure fromclimate shocks, environmental degradation, and limited livelihood opportunities. Recurrent droughts, declining soil fertility, and resource scarcity continue to undermine traditional livelihoods, while economic diversification remains limited. Young people are disproportionately affected, often lacking access to meaningful employment, market-relevant skills, or viable pathways to contribute to household income and community resilience. These challenges are particularly pronounced in rural and peri-urban agropastoral areas.\nAt the same time, Somaliland is experiencing growing environmental pressures linked to underdeveloped market systems. Agricultural residues, organic by-products, plastic waste, and aging technical equipment are accumulating across communities, contributing to pollution, health risks, and lost economic value. These challenges coexist with unmet demand for affordable agricultural inputs, construction materials, and technical services, highlighting a persistent disconnect between available resources, skills, and functioning markets.\nDespite these constraints, Somaliland presents strong entry points for circular economy and green skills innovation, particularly where waste streams intersect with livelihood needs and emerging market demand. Agropastoral livelihoods generate substantial volumes of crop residues and organic by-products that can be transformed into productive inputs such as organic fertilizer. Urban growth and changing consumption patterns have increased plastic waste, while a growing number of local enterprises are demonstrating the feasibility of recycling plastic into construction and consumer products. In parallel, the rapid expansion of solar energy\u2014driven by high electricity costs and limited grid coverage\u2014has created increasing demand for repair and maintenance services, opening new income opportunities for youth through applied green skills.\nTo ensure that the Innovation Challenge responds to real market conditions and user needs, its design was informed by structured engagement with ecosystem actors. This included a co-creation workshop using a human-centred and design-thinking approach to unpack underlying challenges, explore root causes, and frame opportunity areas from the perspective of actors working directly in agropastoral and circular economy settings. Building on these insights, an open market dialogue was conducted with solution providers, private-sector actors, cooperatives, and innovators to scan existing circular solutions, assess how they operate within value chains, and identify system-level constraints and opportunities. These engagements were exploratory and non-procurement in nature, and aimed to ground the Challenge design in practitioner experience and market realities.\nInsights emerging from these engagements point to several consistent patterns across the ecosystem:\nCircular economy activities are present across agropastoral and urban contexts but remainfragmented, with weak coordination between producers, service providers, and markets.\nYouth are already engaged in activities such as waste collection, repair, fabrication, and agro-processing, but often through informal arrangements with limited opportunities for skills upgrading, enterprise development, or income stability.\nSkills development initiatives are frequently delivered as standalone or short-term interventions, with limited alignment to market demand or viable business models.\nAccess to appropriate financial products for circular and youth-led enterprises remains a key constraint to growth and sustainability.\nAcross these engagements, emerging market signals were observed in several circular economy pathways. These include growing interest in organic soil inputs derived from crop residues, increasing acceptance of recycled plastic products in construction and consumer markets, and rising demand for repair, recovery and maintenance services for technical equipment. While these markets are still developing, they demonstrate sufficient activity to support early-stage enterprise growth and youth employment when combined with targeted skills development and market integration.\nTaken together, these conditions point to the need for an innovation challenge that prioritizes market-anchored, youth-focused circular solutions, rather than isolated pilots or training programs. The emphasis is on translating existing skills and local resources into viable services and products, embedding learning within real economic activity, and enabling youth to generate income while contributing to environmental sustainability and climate resilience.\nIn response to these findings, theCircular Economy Innovation Challenge has been designed to support solutions that can be realistically implemented within a six-month period and that strengthen livelihoods, c",

      "description": "Country: Kenya\nOrganization: Danish Refugee Council\nClosing date: 27 Feb 2026\nWho is the Danish Refugee Council?\nFounded in 1956, the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) is a leading international NGO and one of the few with a specific expertise in forced displacement. Active in 40 countries with 9,000 employees and supported by 7,500 volunteers, DRC protects, advocates, and builds sustainable futures for refugees and other displacement affected people and communities. DRC works during displacement at all stages: In the acute crisis, in displacement, when settling and integrating in a new place, or upon return. DRC provides protection and life-saving humanitarian assistance; supports displaced persons in becoming self-reliant and included into hosting societies; and works with civil society and responsible authorities to promote protection of rights and peaceful coexistence.\nDRC has been operational in Kenya since 2005 and is one of the United Nations Refugee Agency\u2019s (UNHCR) largest Implementing Partners in the refugee response. DRC is present in Garissa (Dadaab & Garissa), North Rift (Kakuma, Kalobeyei & Lodwar), Karamoja cluster-Cross border region connecting Kenya and Uganda, Nairobi and Mandera counties\nPurpose of the consultancy\nThe Danish Refugee Council based in Kenyaseeks proposals from a consultancy firm to develop an online climate change information and knowledge platform for Karamoja region (Bordering areas of Kenya-Uganda) exploring opportunities to utilize digital technologies in the information sharing on better climate adaptation to promote cascading of climate information as a way of synergizing early warning system (EWS) sensitization.\nBackground\nClimate risks pose serious threats to Kenya\u2019s sustainable development goals. With the largest economy in East Africa and a population of 54 million, Kenya serves as the region\u2019s financial, trade, and communications hub. The country\u2019s economy is largely dependent on rainfed agriculture and tourism, each susceptible to climate variability and change and extreme weather events. Kenya\u2019s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) notes that successive climate change impacts result in socio-economic losses estimated at 3-4 per cent of Gross Domestic Product annually and impede development efforts. Even though Kenya contributes less than 0.1 per cent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually, it has policies and measures to pursue a low-carbon and resilient development pathway to realize its Vision 2030 to transform Kenya into a newly industrializing, middle-income country.\nKenya is a leader in addressing climate change and was one of the first countries in Africa to enact a comprehensive law and policy to guide national and subnational climate action. The Climate Change Act and the National Climate Change Policy Framework provide guidance for low-carbon and climate-resilient development. Kenya\u2019s priorities as articulated through these, and other, instruments include adaptation, afforestation and reforestation, climate-smart agriculture, geothermal and clean energy development, energy efficiency, and drought management. These priorities are operationalized through a number of sector-specific policies and strategies.\nNorthern Kenya is an arid region inhabited by nomadic pastoralists and characterized by a fragile ecosystem \u2013 ravaged by the effects of climate change and susceptible to insecurity due to regional ethnic and political inter-play within the Kenya-Uganda-Sudan, Ethiopia-Somalia borderlands. The region is also drought-prone, a situation that has depleted livestock, water and pasture. These conditions create an increased need for mobility and better climate adaptation in this field for the survival of pastoralist livelihoods. Pasture and water scarcity continue to be a key driving force for most intercommunal conflicts \u2013 more so along the often insecure and porous border regions. DRC experience in the region suggests that the most effective way of providing support to the pastoralists in the prevailing situation is through the promotion of peaceful co-existence among and within the communities and protecting the communities\u2019 assets, saving lives, building community resilience, addressing vulnerabilities and create awareness on better climate adaptations. Thus, DRC through the\nKaramoja Strong(KSP\n) project is responding to the affected communities by spearheading conflict prevention initiatives through a variety of peace and conflict mitigation initiatives and promotion of sustainable livelihoods for women and youth, community-based natural resource management and better climate adaptation for increased productivity in the boarder areas of Kenya and Uganda\nDRC\u2019s program is designed to serve as a bridge between humanitarian assistance and longer-term recovery and development strategies by identifying entry points to assistance for households at different vulnerability stages: addressing basic needs and reducing reliance on negative coping s",
