      "description": "Countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda\nOrganization: Handicap International - Humanity & Inclusion\nClosing date: 24 Feb 2026\nContract information\nPlace:\nEthiopa/Uganda/Kenya,\nStarting date:\n1st April 2026;\nDuration of contract:\n24 months;\nClosing date for applications:\n24 February 2026.\nHumanity & Inclusion presentation\nHumanity & Inclusion is an independent and impartial aid organisation working in situations of poverty and exclusion, conflict and disaster. The organisation works alongside people with disabilities and vulnerable populations, taking action and bearing witness in order to respond to their essential needs, improve their living conditions and promote respect for their dignity and fundamental rights.\nSince its creation in 1982, HI has run development & humanitarian projects in more than 55 countries and responded to numerous emergencies. Today, we have a budget of approximately 200 million euros, with 4,000 employees worldwide\nAt Handicap International-Humanity & Inclusion, we truly believe in the importance of inclusion and diversity within our organisation. This is why we are engaged to a disability policy to encourage the inclusion and integration of people with disabilities.\nPlease indicate if you require any special accommodation, even at the first interview.\nFor more information about the organisation.\nJOB CONTEXT:\nRegional context\n- East Africa (Ethiopia, Somalia/Somaliland, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan) and later in 2026 possible new countries.\nEast Africa region faces multiple challenges: armed conflicts and insecurity, population displacement (refugees and internally displaced persons), epidemics and public health issues, food insecurity and famine, and various protection incidents. These factors exacerbate the vulnerabilities of people with disabilities and marginalized groups.\nEast Africa is home to approximately 3.8 million refugees, representing 10% of the world's refugees but faces growing challenges in terms of resources and integration.\nOngoing crises in Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia are exacerbating displacement.\nIn this context, Humanity & Inclusion (HI) implements humanitarian and development actions aimed at improving access to essential services, strengthening community resilience, and promoting inclusion. HI's interventions focus on several areas: physical and functional rehabilitation, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), inclusive education (and EI in emergencies), protection, food security and humanitarian mine action (including clearance, victim assistance and risk education). HI's approach is based on community participation, promoting a \u201cdo no harm\u201d policy, and seeking to achieve a lasting impact that promotes human dignity and inclusion in humanitarian action.\nHI has around 350-400 employees in this region, with a budget of \u20ac20 million.\nAs part of its commitment to continuous improvement, HI has embarked on a process of regionalization and decentralization of its operational governance, with the aim of bringing decision-making closer to local realities. This change is accompanied by greater pooling of resources, harmonization of practices, and increased efforts to ensure programmatic consistency across its various areas of intervention. By early 2026, the program teams will work closely and in an integrated manner within a strengthened regional space to maximize the impact, responsiveness, and relevance of actions carried out as close as possible to the populations concerned.\nThe security situation in the region varies from country to country, with some areas affected by tensions or travel restrictions, particularly in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. Appropriate risk management mechanisms are in place to ensure the safety of teams.\nYOUR MISSION:\nUnder the hierarchical supervision of the Technical Head of Program (THOP), and in close collaboration with the Regional Director, Country Managers, Country Directors, country-based business development officers, Operations Managers, shared service managers and other technical Unit members, the Business Development Specialist actively contributes to the development of the East Africa regional program by designing, implementing, and monitoring its fundraising strategy.

Concern operates in some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable and disaster-prone countries, with programs focused on emergency response, health and nutrition, livelihoods, education, and climate resilience. Concern is currently implementing a program in collaboration with Machakos County Government to strengthen the Orange-Fleshed Sweet Potato (OFSP) value chain, with a particular focus on increased OFSP production, value addition and strengthening of market linkages. As part of the initiative, the program seeks to enhance access to certified, drought-tolerant OFSP seed varieties for smallholder farmers within the county. The OFSP variety is a critical crop in addressing food security and nutrition (Vitamin A-Beta Carotine) ensuring the availability of quality planting materials in Machakos County. Orange-Fleshed Sweet potato (OFSP) has a precursor of Vitamin A and has been promoted as a key intervention in addressing micronutrient deficiencies, especially in vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women.\nMachakos County was selected for the project based on a comprehensive assessment of its potential for integration into the OFSP value chain. Key factors considered included (i) proximity to Nairobi, the economic and consumption hub, (ii) a suitable environment for OFSP production, (iii) high agricultural production potential, and (iv) the capacity and demand of the local community. Agriculture employs 75% of the County population. However, the lack of proper farming techniques has resulted in a harvest of less than 10 tons of OFSP per hectare, limiting farmers' income. With the adoption of appropriate agricultural techniques, yields can increase by at least 1.5 times, reaching 15\u201330 tons per hectare. The project, therefore, aims at directly or indirectly mitigating the effects of low agricultural productivity on farmers\u2019 income and reducing high vulnerability to climate change.\nPurpose of the Consultancy\nThe purpose of this consultancy is to provide\nhigh-quality photography and videography services\nthat highlight project activities, community voices, and programme outcomes across all the project sites\nThe consultant will produce:\nStill photographs\nShort videos suitable for social media and reporting\nBrief written profiles of interviewees\nInterview recordings in the language preferred by interviewees\nObjectives and Scope of Work (specific tasks)\nObjectives\nCapture quality visual and audio material that represents the work and impact of the Triple M Project.\nProvide usable content for reporting, visibility, learning, and communication.\nTasks\nLiaise with Concern staff to understand priorities, sites, and target outputs.\nVisit assigned project sites within Machakos County as scheduled.\nCapture:\nHigh-quality photographs\nShort videos (1\u20133 minutes), including interviews and activity footage\nConduct interviews in Kamba, Kiswahili, or English as appropriate.\nPrepare short written profiles of interviewees and caption information for all photos.\nProvide raw files and edited versions of photos and videos.\nEnsure all content is ethically collected and aligned with safeguarding requirements.\nSubmit final outputs within the agreed timeframe.\nOutputs\nThe consultant will deliver:\nA set of\nhigh-resolution photographs\norganised by activity and location.\nA collection of\nshort, edited videos\n(1\u20133 minutes each) suitable for social media and reporting.\nRaw footage and raw photos.\nBrief written profiles of interviewees and captions for all images.\nA short documentation note summarising activities completed.\nEssential and Desirable Qualifications\nEssential\nProven experience in videography and photography for development, humanitarian, or community-focused projects.\nAbility to communicate in Kamba, Kiswahili, and English.\nAbility to conduct interviews in the interviewee\u2019s preferred language.\nCapacity to prepare brief written profiles and captions.\nOwnership and use of professional equipment, including:\nHD camera\nMicrophone for clear audio capture\nAbility to work flexibly and travel to field sites when needed.\nExperience working in similar assignments with NGOs, CBOs, or development agencies.\nAbility to provide a detailed workplan before commencement.\nDesirable\nKnowledge of Machakos County context.\nFamiliarity with humanitarian or development themes.\nExperience producing short social media videos\nPayments\nConcern Worldwide will provide payment upon the successful d",

      "description": "Country: Kenya\nOrganization: FSD Kenya\nClosing date: 18 Feb 2026\nBackground\nFinancial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD Kenya) is an independent trust dedicated to the achievement of a financial system that delivers value for a green and inclusive digital economy while improving financial health and capability for women and micro and small enterprises (MSEs). FSD Kenya works closely with the public sector, the financial services industry, and other partners to develop financial solutions that better address the real-world challenges that low-income households, micro and small enterprises, and underserved groups such as women and youth face. Current FSD Kenya funders are the United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), The Gates Foundation, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). To learn more about our work, refer to our\nwebsite\n.\nThe Green Finance for Youth Employment (GFYE) Project is a four-year Project (\n2024-2027\n) that is funded by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MFA) of Finland in partnership with the National Treasury of Kenya and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Project is aimed at creating decent jobs for the youth in green value chains operating in rural Kenya, specifically by addressing key constraints for private sector financing that is required for effective youth job creation. The intended impact of the Project is for the rural youth to have increased and resilient incomes through green livelihoods, which is to be achieved through scalable green investment models for the youth and access to sustainable financing and investments for youth and rural enterprises that is youth-led or youth-employing. The Project target low-income rural youth aged between 18-35 years involved in both on-farm and off-farm activities in 14 Counties in Kenya, with at least 50% of the targeted youth being women.\nThe 14 target Counties are: Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Embu, Machakos, Nakuru, Kisii, Siaya, Nandi, Kakamega, Busia, Bungoma and Trans Nzoia.\nThe project will be implemented through three inter-related components:\nComponent 1\n: Scalable green business models and products for the youth, with a focus on the identification and classification of existing scalable green business models and targeted financial products for young women and men that operate in the Kenyan food system. A key objective of this component is to provide an evidence base and solid framework for the capacity building and financing components of the project (Component 2-3).\nComponent 2:\nCapacity building for green investments for youth employment, including building the capacity of young women and men and youth-led and youth employing MSMEs to access and effectively use green financing. This Component also includes dedicated capacity building on the supply side, i.e. financial institutions operating in rural areas such as SACCOs and MFBs.\nComponent 3: De-risking for increased green financing to the project target group through a piloting a \u201cYouth Green Loan Product\u201d, to be implemented by the National Treasury.\nFSD Kenya is an implementing partner of the GFYE Project and is responsible for the implementation of Component 1, jointly with other GFYE implementing partners and stakeholders. One of the planned activities under Component 1 is a scoping analysis of commercially viable green and sustainable business models and employment opportunities for the youth, women and persons with disabilities in the 14 target Counties. However, it is not just about identifying viable enterprises but identifying those that are commercially viable and can be financed by participating financial institutions (PFIs) in the GFYE project. As such, the scoping analysis will include an assessment of financial institutions, business and enterprise support organisations that are financing and supporting these businesses.

For those who can safely remain in the country to which they have fled, we help them reach stability and work towards self-reliance so they can meet their own needs. Unfortunately, many refugees can\u2019t go home and can\u2019t safely stay in the country to which they have fled. We help these people relocate to a safe, new country, through resettlement or other pathways so that they can begin to rebuild their lives. RefugePoint helps refugees access these solutions using three tactics: direct services, field building, and systems change. Through this three-pronged approach we provide direct services to thousands of refugees each year, strengthen the capacity of other organizations to better serve refugees, and influence global policy and practice to transform refugee response systems.\nLasting solutions work. Directly, we\u2019ve referred over 140,000 refugees for resettlement or other pathways to a safe, third country. We\u2019ve also equipped thousands of refugees with the tools to support themselves and their families in the country to which they\u2019ve fled. Through innovation, collaboration, and influence, we've helped lead the sector in expanding long-lasting, refugee-centered solutions, and instigated major sea changes in global practice.\nYou will be joining a growing organization (115+ staff globally) that is spearheading new initiatives that are changing the face of humanitarian response, and we would be excited to have you as part of our team!\nOUR VALUES\nRefugePoint has core, cross-cutting principles and values that define our work:\nRefugee-Centered:\nWe create space for and elevate refugee voices and leadership within the organization to guide our work.\nAnti-Racist & Anti-Colonial:\nRecognizing that racism, colonialism, and global white supremacy culture have caused many of the inequities driving the world\u2019s refugee situations, we seek to integrate and center anti-racist and anti-colonialist principles in all that we do.\nEquity-Focused:\nWe deliver services, build capacity, and influence policies and systems to strengthen equity in the humanitarian sector.\nTrauma-Informed:\nWe integrate a trauma-informed approach and offer mental health and psycho-social support services to clients and staff.\nEvidence-Informed Practice:\nWe use an evidence-informed approach to practice, i.e., the integration of research evidence alongside practitioner expertise and the people experiencing the practice.\nCollaborative:\nThe urgency of need and the magnitude of the problem requires shared responsibility and shared action. We seek opportunities to engage in networks and partnerships.\nPOSITION OVERVIEW\nThe Graphic Designer plays a key role in bringing RefugePoint\u2019s mission, impact, and stories to life through compelling, mission-aligned visual design.

      "description": "Country: Kenya\nOrganization: Kakenya\u2019s Dream\nClosing date: 13 Feb 2026\n1. About the organization\nKakenya's Dream is a nonprofit organization that invests in girls from rural communities through education, health, and leadership initiatives. Our programs operate in Transmara, one of the remotest and most marginalized regions of Kenya, where nearly 66% of girls continue to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM) at puberty, 50% are married before the age of 19, and only 17% complete primary education. Kakenya\u2019s Dream has expanded its programs to Kenyenya Sub-County in Kisii County. Girls\u2019 education is not a priority for family or community investment, and social norms perpetuate low educational achievement. Investing in girls\u2019 education yields profoundly positive outcomes not only for the girl, but for her family and community as well.\nOur interconnected programs provide educational opportunities including professional skills development for vulnerable girls and train youth and advocate to the community at large on sexual and reproductive health and rights, provide direct health care services to the surrounding community, and build resilience to climate change in marginalized communities.\na) Education\n: We have two centres for Excellence, Kakenya Centre for Excellence I (KCE I) and Kakenya Centre for Excellence II (KCE II). The two, KCE I and KCE II currently provide safe, and supportive boarding facilities and education to 454 from grade 4 to 12 learners.The program takes a holistic approach to educating girls, incorporating health and leadership elements into the curriculum and providing for all physical and social-emotional needs. We support 185 girls through our Education Access program where they receive mentorship, financial support, and a variety of essential resources to help them succeed in secondary and tertiary education.\nb) Health\n: In the communities we serve, there are several concerns like early child mariages, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), Sexual Violence, teenage preganancies among other harmful practices that needs to be addressed. We have two major programs to address these issues, The Jijue Training, and the Linda Dada campaigns. These programs aim to impact the knowledge, attitude, and practices of our target group on harmful cultural practices. The Jijue program is an out-of-school training where the focus is to train young girls and boys on Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRH). More than 40,000 youths have received training through the Jijue Training. The Linda Dada Program focuses on extending these training to the community through a participatory approach. We have trained over 20,000 youths, parents, and local leaders on fighting harmful practices through the Linda Dada Campaigns. We launched Kakenya Health and Wellness Centre (KHWC), a clinic that serves both girls in our school programs and the community by providing basic healthcare services. The KHWC has served over 21,000 people from the community including learners from our schools.\nc) Economic Empowerment\n: Unemployment remains a big challenge even for those with extensive education qualification in rural Kenya. Kakenya\u2019s Dream helps young women transition from school to securing meaningful employment through robust programs that address the unique challenge of unemployment. We equip them with the relevant skills, networks, and the necessary support they require to succeed in the competitive job market, fostering independence and breaking cycles of dependency.\nd) Climate Resilience\n: As climate changes accelerate, women and young girls in rural Kenya and specifically in Narok and Kisii Counties are exposed to increased risks and challenges that directly impact their health, education and future. We have integrated environmental education into the curriculum in our schools and implemented community-wide conservation and climate resilience initiatives.\ne) Institutional Effectiveness, Growth and Sustainability\n: We ensure that our institutional growth and sustainability enables more girls to access the much needed services and achieve their dreams through the four key areas of our focus. The organization focuses on capacity building of its staff and strengthening our systems to adapt and respond to the dynamic global changes.\n2. Background\nSince 2019, the Kakenya's Dream (KD) has implemented the Jijue training (\"know yourself\" in Swahili) targeting learners in Grade 5,6 and 7. Implemented over three years, the Jijue program aims to foster positive change among in-school adolescent girls and boys by creating awareness of and building self-efficacy to overcome barriers in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and harmful practices (HPs), including child marriage and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). Adolescence is a critical stage when health behaviors are established, patterns of nonfatal disease burden emerge, and risk-taking behaviors are initiated. A large share of the overall health burden among adolescents is attribut",

Founded in 1933 at the call of Albert Einstein, the IRC is one of the world's largest international humanitarian non-governmental organizations (INGO), at work in more than 40 countries and 29 U.S. cities helping people to survive, reclaim control of their future and strengthen their communities. A force for humanity, IRC employees deliver lasting impact by restoring safety, dignity and hope to millions. If you're a solutions-driven, passionate change-maker, come join us in positively impacting the lives of millions of people world-wide for a better future.\nThe IRC opened the country program in South Sudan in 1989.

The crisis has resulted in widespread displacement, severe food insecurity, and a breakdown of essential services, impacting millions of people. The recent crisis in neighbouring Sudan has further exacerbated the situation, leading to an influx of refugees and increased tension along the border, straining already limited resources and worsening humanitarian needs.

      "description": "Country: Uganda\nOrganizations: Chemonics, Famine Early Warning System Network\nClosing date: 17 Feb 2026\nIntroduction\nThe Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) is an integrated set of activities funded by the United States Government (USG) and is intended to provide timely, accurate, evidence-based, and transparent food insecurity early warning information and analysis. Created in 1985 in response to famines in East and West Africa, FEWS NET provides global coverage of acute food insecurity. FEWS NET\u2019s work is implemented across several mechanisms by a team of partners that includes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the University of California-Santa Barbara\u2019s Climate Hazards Center (UCSB-CHC), University of Maryland\u2019s Department of Geographical Sciences, American Institutes for Research (AIR), and Chemonics International (Chemonics). Chemonics implements FEWS NET\u2019s Decision Support Team (DST), which is charged with providing integrated monitoring and analyses of current and forecast acute food insecurity in countries worldwide to support the United States Government\u2019s (USG) policy and programmatic decisions. The DST operates through a Washington-based technical office, regional FEWS NET offices, and national staff presence in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and eastern Europe.\nFEWS NET\u2019s objective is to produce timely, evidence-based decision support to enable the efficient allocation of humanitarian assistance on the basis of need.\nBased on an in-depth understanding of local livelihoods, FEWS NET monitors information and data on factors that affect food security, such as conflict, weather and agroclimatology, crops, pasture, markets and trade, and nutrition. The FEWS NET DST produces regular reports, including Food Security Outlooks and Outlook Updates, emergency alerts, market and price updates, and targeted analyses. FEWS NET makes reports available at\nwww.fews.net\nand distributes them globally to governments, relief agencies, and other organizations engaged in humanitarian response and development programs.\nThe eighth phase of FEWS NET began in 2024. The work of the FEWS NET DST relies on close collaboration with international, regional, and national partners on food security-related data and information gathering and analysis. Major activities include joint monitoring and assessments, data sharing and exchanges, collaborative analysis and reporting, and support of local and regional food security networks.\nPosition Description\nThe FEWS NET DST maintains virtual and physical field offices in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Five regional offices coordinate and oversee the technical and administrative management of over 40 country offices. Each country office falls into one of three tiers, depending on the complexity of the context and operating environment. Tier 1 countries require a larger staffing footprint, while Tier 3 countries require a smaller one. There are four main technical positions at the country level: Country Technical Lead (CTL); Country Technical Manager (CTM); Country Technical Senior Specialist for Food Security (CTSS-FS); and Country Technical Senior Specialist for Conflict (CTSS-C).\nThe CTSS-C will be responsible for providing an assessment of conflict and violence dynamics in support of food security analysis. The CTSS-C, under the direction and guidance of the CTL and the Regional Technical Senior Specialist\u2013Conflict (RTSS-C), who work in close alignment with the home office-based Security & Conflict Advisor, is responsible for supporting the following activities, in collaboration with other technical staff in the country:\nProviding efficient monitoring, assessment, and early warning analysis as it pertains to conflict, food security, and conflicts\u2019 impacts on food insecurity.

      "description": "Country: Uganda\nOrganization: Tiko\nClosing date: 13 Feb 2026\nBackground and context\nTiko Africa is an African non-profit organization founded in 2014, dedicated to empowering adolescent girls and young women(AGYW) aged 15\u201324 in low-income communities. Our work focuses on improving the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of AGYW in Sub-Saharan Africa, addressing the \u201cTriple Threat\u201d of early pregnancy, HIV, and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).\nIn Uganda, Tiko partners with private franchised and non-franchised health facilities, Public health facilities, and Local government authorities (Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) and Wakiso). Through these partnerships, Tiko ensures AGYW have access to high-quality HIV, SRH, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV), and mental health services supported by high-quality and verifiable data. The Tiko platform (accessible via SMS, WhatsApp, Tiko cards for AGYW, and a light Android app for mobilizers and providers) enables real-time data collection and program management.\nMaintaining the integrity and reliability of programmatic data is critical for evidence-based decision-making, regulatory reporting, and service delivery.\nScope of Work\nTiko Africa seeks a qualified consultant to conduct routine, systematic Data Quality Audits (RDQAs) and facilitate Strategic Data Review Sessions at Tiko-supported health facilities in Kampala and Wakiso.\nCoordination and Joint DQA Participation: Working closely with Tiko, the consultant will support coordination with the local government authorities (KCCA and Wakiso District) to facilitate and participate in joint on-site RDQA activities.\nOn-Site RDQA Execution: Conduct full on-site RDQA processes, including data extraction, tallying, and comparative verification between services reported on the Tiko platform and official primary source registers (HMIS).\nDocument key process observations, facility capacity gaps, and the condition of health records at the facilities visited. The RDQA must also include documentation of broader contextual factors (e.g., donor funding shifts or new health policies) that could impact data quality or service delivery.\nRoot cause analysis and action planning: Identify the root causes of discrepancies (e.g., staff attitude, stock-outs, misunderstanding of the Tiko app, transcription errors, or intentional data falsification). Findings must be triangulated, and observations and corrective action points must be developed collaboratively with facility staff.\nReporting: Submit compiled raw data and clean datasets, along with a detailed Comparative Checks Report documenting all variances, root causes, and recommended corrective actions.\nFollow-Up: Conduct structured post-RDQA follow-ups to ensure all action points have been addressed before the next audit cycle.\nSupport for Facility Data Review Sessions: The consultant will support Tiko in executing quarterly Facility Data Review Sessions, which focus on strategic performance deep-dives. These sessions will involve facility in-charges, providers, data personnel, mobilizers (YAPs \u2013 Young Adolescent Peer Supporters), and Tiko staff, to foster ownership and close the data-use feedback loop. The consultant will present performance trends (before/after analysis), demand generation trends, and Quality Assurance (QA) findings, explicitly linking data discrepancies to the Facility Improvement Plan (FIP) to highlight potential financial and reputational implications. Each session will cover the previous six months\u2019 performance and track progress on agreed strategic goals.\nObjectives of the Routine Data Quality Audits (RDQAs)\nRigorously verify the accuracy of reported data against national HMIS tools and data.\nLeverage Facility Data Review Sessions to go beyond compliance, identify gaps, and drive continuous performance improvements.\nEnsure that all previous action points are fully addressed before the start of each new audit cycle.\nMethodology\nQuantitative: Physical verification of registers and service counts using RDQA tools.\nData Triangulation (System Cross-Referencing): Conducting a three-way comparison of data points to ensure consistency across all reporting levels: Tiko Platform Data, Facility Source Documents (Primary Registers), National Health Information System (DHIS2)\nQualitative: Root cause analysis interviews.\nFollow-up and gap closure: Ensure that issues from previous RDQAs have been addressed and gaps closed\nParticipatory: Facilitation of Facility Data Review Sessions to discuss findings and demand generation trends without conducting new service counts.\nDeliverables\nThe timelines below reflect the monthly operational cycle for Q1 2026 and subsequent quarters.\nActivity:\nProject Inception.\nTime Frame:\nBy Mar 13, 2026.\nDeliverable:\nInception Report (.ppt slide deck) including team structure, work plan, risk matrix, and a specific strategy for engaging KCCA/Wakiso officials.\nActivity:\nMonthly RDQAs & Follow-ups.\nTime Frame:\nBy the 25th of every month.\n",
