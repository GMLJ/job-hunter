These factors exacerbate the vulnerabilities of people with disabilities and marginalized groups.\nEast Africa is home to approximately 3.8 million refugees, representing 10% of the world's refugees but faces growing challenges in terms of resources and integration.\nOngoing crises in Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia are exacerbating displacement.\nIn this context, Humanity & Inclusion (HI) implements humanitarian and development actions aimed at improving access to essential services, strengthening community resilience, and promoting inclusion. HI's interventions focus on several areas: physical and functional rehabilitation, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), inclusive education (and EI in emergencies), protection, food security and humanitarian mine action (including clearance, victim assistance and risk education). HI's approach is based on community participation, promoting a \u201cdo no harm\u201d policy, and seeking to achieve a lasting impact that promotes human dignity and inclusion in humanitarian action.\nHI has around 350-400 employees in this region, with a budget of \u20ac20 million.\nAs part of its commitment to continuous improvement, HI has embarked on a process of regionalization and decentralization of its operational governance, with the aim of bringing decision-making closer to local realities. This change is accompanied by greater pooling of resources, harmonization of practices, and increased efforts to ensure programmatic consistency across its various areas of intervention. By early 2026, the program teams will work closely and in an integrated manner within a strengthened regional space to maximize the impact, responsiveness, and relevance of actions carried out as close as possible to the populations concerned.\nThe security situation in the region varies from country to country, with some areas affected by tensions or travel restrictions, particularly in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. Appropriate risk management mechanisms are in place to ensure the safety of teams.\nYOUR MISSION:\nUnder the hierarchical supervision of the Technical Head of Program (THOP), and in close collaboration with the Regional Director, Country Managers, Country Directors, country-based business development officers, Operations Managers, shared service managers and other technical Unit members, the Business Development Specialist actively contributes to the development of the East Africa regional program by designing, implementing, and monitoring its fundraising strategy.

The intervention focuses on optimizing existing water pumping operations by conducting energy audits, resizing pumps to match borehole yields, and introducing smart energy management systems. It further promotes the transition to renewable energy through rehabilitation and expansion of solar-powered and hybrid pumping systems. In parallel, the project will increase water storage capacity and improve distribution efficiency through hydraulic modeling and network optimization, reducing energy losses and enhancing service reliability. Overall, the project will strengthen water service delivery for over 665,000 people by reducing operational costs, increasing system resilience, and supporting environmentally sustainable water management.\nComponent 2:Water loss reduction and increased water use efficiency to mitigate waste of freshwater and ensure efficient water supply services.\nThis component focuses on improving water system efficiency and reducing losses across transmission, distribution, and end-user levels. It includes rehabilitation of existing water transmission and distribution networks, as well as repairs to water storage infrastructure to minimize physical losses. The project will establish Demand Management Areas (DMAs) through the installation of bulk meters at 140 boreholes and tanks, along with metering at kiosks, institutions, and camps, enabling improved monitoring and management of water use across 720 connection points. In parallel, water-use efficiency at the household and community level will be enhanced through the introduction of smart water dispensers and behavior change interventions. Collectively, these measures will improve accountability, reduce non-revenue water, and enhance sustainable water access for approximately 660,000 beneficiaries.\nComponent 3: Strengthening institutional and community level water management through technical assistance, and capacity-building of water utility personnel,and training of community water managers and local community.\nThis component focuses on strengthening institutional capacity and governance for sustainable and climate-resilient water service delivery. It includes an assessment of the capacity needs of the county public water utility to ensure it can meet service standards and climate adaptation requirements, followed by the development of an institutional strengthening roadmap and targeted capacity-building program. The component also promotes inclusive water governance through the establishment of community watershed management clusters, with a strong emphasis on engaging women and youth and strengthening collaboration between communities and the utility. In parallel, the project will support the integration of water supply planning into municipal urban development processes, ensuring that climate adaptation and water resource management are systematically incorporated into long-term municipal planning and decision-making.\nThis ESIA will focus on environmental and social risk assessment, fragility and resilience assessment, risk mitigation planning, and regulatory compliance for the project as described.\nTo inform project appraisal, detailed design, and implementation, Peace Winds Japan seeks to engage a qualified national consultant to conduct an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) in accordance with Kenyan regulations and applicable donor safeguard requirements.\nProject Sites\nThe proposed project will be implemented in Kakuma Refugee Camp,Kalobeyei Integrated Settlement, Daadab Refugee Complex and surrounding host communities.\n2.

      "description": "Country: Kenya\nOrganization: FSD Kenya\nClosing date: 20 Feb 2026\nBACKGROUND\nFinancial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD Kenya) is an independent trust dedicated to the achievement of a financial system that delivers value for a green and inclusive digital economy while improving financial health and capability for women and micro and small enterprises (MSEs). FSD Kenya works closely with the public sector, the financial services industry, and other partners to develop financial solutions that better address the real-world challenges low-income households, micro and small enterprises, and underserved groups such as women and youth face. Current FSD Kenya funders include the United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), The Gates Foundation, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the French Development Agency (AFD).\nThe Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) was established in 1969 by an Act of Parliament (the Agricultural Finance Corporation Act (Cap 323 Laws of Kenya) to provide affordable credit to actors in Kenya\u2019s agricultural value chains. The specific objective and mandate as set out in the Act is to \u2018\u2019assist in the development of agriculture and agricultural industries by making loans to farmers, cooperative societies, incorporated group representatives, private companies, public bodies, local authorities and other persons engaging in agriculture or agricultural industries\u2019\u2019. With a network spread across the country, AFC\u2019s current mission is to provide sustainable financing though participative and collaborative financial and non-financial interventions, innovations, technology and products.\nIn the recent past, AFC has undergone a strategic refocusing with the objective of transforming into a sustainable and impactful market maker in Kenya\u2019s agricultural finance market. Part of this transformation has included a shift in its operating model to incorporate wholesale financing as one of its business models, adding on to its existing retail lending model. Under its wholesale financing model, AFC provides wholesale funds to SACCOs, microfinance institutions and anchor clients that in turn finance unserved and underserved segments in the agricultural value chains. In addition to wholesale financing, AFC has also implemented other new business models including warehouse receipt financing, mechanization financing and the provision of credit guarantees to de-risk agricultural enterprises.\nIn recognition of its transformation, AFC was selected as the apex institution to implement the Green Finance Facility (GFF) under the Rural Kenya Financial Inclusion Facility (RK-FINFA) Project. RK-FINFA is a six-year development project financed jointly by the IFAD and the Government of Kenya to support the transformation of rural and smallholder agriculture through private sector-led development by improving access to affordable and appropriate financial services by smallholder farmers and micro, small and medium enterprises. The GFF is established as a facility to provide wholesale capital to rural oriented SACCOs, microfinance banks (MFBs) and microfinance institutions for on-lending to smallholder farmers and rural micro enterprises for financing activities and projects in climate change adaptation and mitigation, improved environmental management and improved efficiencies in the use of natural resources. AFC\u2019s allocation under the GFF is KShs 1.080bn with three Microfinance Banks and five SACCOs already contracted for wholesale financing for on-lending to retail borrowers.\nAFC\u2019s role under the GFF is pivotal to address two key interrelated challenges. First, Kenya\u2019s agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to climate change and climate variability. The dependence on rain-fed agriculture and the occurrence of extreme weather events including flooding and drought have significantly impacted production and productivity, with direct effects on Kenya\u2019s food security and cascading effect on the economy. At the same time, the agricultural sector has an important impact on land use and land cover including deforestation and forest degradation as large swathes of land are cleared and converted into farmland. Second, while finance plays a pivotal role in greening Kenya\u2019s economic growth and has been identified as a critical enabler for climate change mitigation and adaptation, the financing of green investments remains limited due to several factors. By one measure, Kenya\u2019s total annual financing gap is estimated at USD 5.13bn. Further downstream, survey data shows that households\u2019 access to formal finance for green investments remain low.\nDiscussions with key potential wholesale borrowers of the GFF indicate strong demand for capital for innovative green investments. Leading financial institutions consider green financing as a key strategy in their future operations, and some are already offering green products to their c",

IRC currently delivers multi sectoral programming directly and through partners across seven states and two administrative areas. These include Northern Bahr el Ghazal, covering Aweil East, Aweil West, and Aweil South counties, Unity State, covering Rubkona, Koch, and Panyijiar counties, Upper Nile State, covering Maban, Renk, Panyikang, Nasir, Ulang, and Panylgang counties, Lakes State, covering Rumbek Centre, Rumbek East, and Yirol West counties, Central Equatoria, covering Juba, Yei, and Kajokeji counties, Eastern Equatoria, covering Kapoeta East, Jonglei, covering Ayod, Twic East, Uror, Akobo counties, as well as Abyei Administrative Area and Ruweng Administrative Area, including Pariang County and Ajoung Thok and Pamir refugee camps.\nBackground and objectives of Education for all South Sudan(EFASS)\nSouth Sudan has one of the world's most fragile education systems, with approximately 2.8 to 3 million children, representing around 60 to 70 percent of the school-age population, out of school. Foundational literacy and numeracy outcomes remain critically low, with less than 10 percent of children achieving minimum reading competency. Years of conflict, accelerating climate shocks, and government education expenditure under 3 percent of the national budget have created an entrenched crisis. Girls and children with disabilities are disproportionately affected by these barriers, with harmful gender norms and stigma further limiting their access to education.\nEFASS is a \u00a327 million, four-year programme (April 2026 to March 2030), designed to deliver five interlinked outcomes. These include improving access, retention, and progression for the most marginalised out-of-school children, particularly girls and children with disabilities in conflict and climate-affected areas. The programme also targets improved foundational learning outcomes in literacy and numeracy, strengthened delivery of inclusive and climate-adaptive education approaches by teachers and facilitators, improved education data and evidence for decision-making through a national Learning Outcomes and Quality Assessment, as well as strengthened pathways for system uptake and sustainability beyond EFASS.\nScope of Work\nThe CASH Transfers Lead will serve as the technical lead for all Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) activities under EFASS, overseeing the design, implementation, management, and continuous improvement of cash transfer delivery at scale across South Sudan. This senior technical position requires expertise in managing large-scale cash transfer programmes in fragile and conflict-affected contexts, with a strong focus on ensuring Value for Money (VfM), fiduciary risk management, safeguarding, and adaptive programme management.\nThis role requires overseeing the complete end-to-end cash delivery process, from beneficiary identification and registration through to payment distribution and post-distribution monitoring. This includes managing complex relationships with financial service providers, banks, payment agents, and implementing partners , while coordinating closely with Government of South Sudan counterparts, the Ministry of General Education and Instruction, and key stakeholders. A central aspect of this role involves comprehensive risk management and safeguarding in challenging operating environments.\nThe position requires exceptional strategic leadership and adaptive programme delivery, ensuring that FCDO's investment achieves maximum impact while protecting public funds in a high-risk environment. This involves making evidence-based decisions about scaling transfers up or down in response to changing needs, climate shocks, displacement, or budget adjustments, while exploring and piloting innovative approaches such as anticipatory action triggers linked to climate events. The role demands strong analytical capabilities to generate learning from programme implementation, contribute to the global evidence base on cash transfers in fragile contexts, monitor gender parity and disability inclusion indicators to inform targeting decisions, and work within an adaptive management framework that allows for course correction based on monitoring data and emerging contextual realities in South Sudan's complex and fluid operating environment.\nCASH Leads Responsibilities\nLead the strategic design and implementation of nationwide cash transfer interventions targeting girls and children with disabilities\nDevelop and maintain a clear, feasible end-to-end process for timely and secure delivery of cash transfers across all states\nDesign and oversee robust mechanisms for identifying eligible beneficiaries using Washington Group Questions\nEnsure cash transfer strategies integrate with behaviour change communication (BCC) activities and align with evidence of effective p",

For those who can safely remain in the country to which they have fled, we help them reach stability and work towards self-reliance so they can meet their own needs. Unfortunately, many refugees can\u2019t go home and can\u2019t safely stay in the country to which they have fled. We help these people relocate to a safe, new country, through resettlement or other pathways so that they can begin to rebuild their lives. RefugePoint helps refugees access these solutions using three tactics: direct services, field building, and systems change. Through this three-pronged approach we provide direct services to thousands of refugees each year, strengthen the capacity of other organizations to better serve refugees, and influence global policy and practice to transform refugee response systems.\nLasting solutions work. Directly, we\u2019ve referred over 140,000 refugees for resettlement or other pathways to a safe, third country. We\u2019ve also equipped thousands of refugees with the tools to support themselves and their families in the country to which they\u2019ve fled.

For example:\nThe President\u2019s office co-owns the youth priority within One Acre Fund. Youth are demographically important to our future - for every older farmer, there are 2 youth farmers in the markets we work. Youth are vital to keep One Acre Fund programs relevant in the coming decade. The Mastercard Foundation has resourced us to do this, and the president co-manages a team of five people who spearhead this work within One Acre Fund.\nOne Acre Fund has a goal of providing nutritious crops like green leafy vegetables, iron-rich beans, and textured vegetable protein to 2+ million families by 2030. We have an opportunity to build on existing programming, work with program teams to design new programming, and monitor through to end outcomes.\nWe are coordinating a grant that is routing through our UK entity and will then flow to our Malawi entity, and making appropriate governance changes.\nProject management.\nYou will support special projects related to the President\u2019s portfolio.\nThe President is helping to coordinate a project about One Acre Fund financial resource stewardship, and how we scale programs up/ down with changes in donor funds. This project touches on our core budgeting and governance principles, and helps to drive new thinking on how we do long-term financial planning.\nThe President is doing some initial research into a gene-edited soil amendment which would reduce conventional fertilizer requirements. This technology has relevance to both our program and external stakeholders. Our office has been delegated to coordinate our research and investigation here, with a priority on health and safety \u2013 and while balancing science, government priorities, donor priorities, public comms in our program countries, and program priorities.\nBoards are a growing area of work at One Acre Fund \u2013 our US, UK, NL boards, and possible new SPV launches.\nTeam management.\nThe office of the President will have 3-4 professionals at any given time, plus has dotted-line management to a few other team members.\nCareer Growth and Development\nWe have a culture of constant learning, and we invest in developing our people. The President is also particularly invested in this role, and the explicit purpose is for the deputy to eventually be doing almost everything that the President currently does (enabling him to expand his scope).\nQualifications\nAcross all roles, these are the\ngeneral qualifications we look for\n. For this role specifically, you will have:\nSeeking a long-term career.\nWe are seeking candidates interested in developing into One Acre Fund top leadership, and so are looking for people who could realistically envision spending their next decade at One Acre Fund, if the",
