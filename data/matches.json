The organisation works alongside people with disabilities and vulnerable populations, taking action and bearing witness in order to respond to their essential needs, improve their living conditions and promote respect for their dignity and fundamental rights.\nSince its creation in 1982, HI has run development & humanitarian projects in more than 55 countries and responded to numerous emergencies. Today, we have a budget of approximately 200 million euros, with 4,000 employees worldwide\nAt Handicap International-Humanity & Inclusion, we truly believe in the importance of inclusion and diversity within our organisation. This is why we are engaged to a disability policy to encourage the inclusion and integration of people with disabilities.\nPlease indicate if you require any special accommodation, even at the first interview.\nFor more information about the organisation.\nJOB CONTEXT:\nRegional context\n- East Africa (Ethiopia, Somalia/Somaliland, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan) and later in 2026 possible new countries.\nEast Africa region faces multiple challenges: armed conflicts and insecurity, population displacement (refugees and internally displaced persons), epidemics and public health issues, food insecurity and famine, and various protection incidents. These factors exacerbate the vulnerabilities of people with disabilities and marginalized groups.\nEast Africa is home to approximately 3.8 million refugees, representing 10% of the world's refugees but faces growing challenges in terms of resources and integration.\nOngoing crises in Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia are exacerbating displacement.\nIn this context, Humanity & Inclusion (HI) implements humanitarian and development actions aimed at improving access to essential services, strengthening community resilience, and promoting inclusion. HI's interventions focus on several areas: physical and functional rehabilitation, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), inclusive education (and EI in emergencies), protection, food security and humanitarian mine action (including clearance, victim assistance and risk education). HI's approach is based on community participation, promoting a \u201cdo no harm\u201d policy, and seeking to achieve a lasting impact that promotes human dignity and inclusion in humanitarian action.\nHI has around 350-400 employees in this region, with a budget of \u20ac20 million.\nAs part of its commitment to continuous improvement, HI has embarked on a process of regionalization and decentralization of its operational governance, with the aim of bringing decision-making closer to local realities. This change is accompanied by greater pooling of resources, harmonization of practices, and increased efforts to ensure programmatic consistency across its various areas of intervention. By early 2026, the program teams will work closely and in an integrated manner within a strengthened regional space to maximize the impact, responsiveness, and relevance of actions carried out as close as possible to the populations concerned.\nThe security situation in the region varies from country to country, with some areas affected by tensions or travel restrictions, particularly in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. Appropriate risk management mechanisms are in place to ensure the safety of teams.\nYOUR MISSION:\nUnder the hierarchical supervision of the Technical Head of Program (THOP), and in close collaboration with the Regional Director, Country Managers, Country Directors, country-based business development officers, Operations Managers, shared service managers and other technical Unit members, the Business Development Specialist actively contributes to the development of the East Africa regional program by designing, implementing, and monitoring its fundraising strategy.

CRS\u2019 relief and development work is accomplished through programs of emergency response, HIV, health, agriculture, education, microfinance, and peacebuilding.\nBackground\nUnder the Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation strategic priority area, CRS aims to \u2018drive uptake and scaling of nature-based solutions and novel financing mechanisms to support national and community level efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change\u2019. Within the Program Management Unit focused on scaling nature-based solutions and novel financing mechanisms, CRS has established a Market System Development unit.

The M4R project concentrates its efforts on 18 districts located in the Midwest, Rwenzori, and Elgon regions of Uganda, and links closely with the Climate Asset Management funded \u2018Restore Africa\u2019 Initiative.

For those who can safely remain in the country to which they have fled, we help them reach stability and work towards self-reliance so they can meet their own needs. Unfortunately, many refugees can\u2019t go home and can\u2019t safely stay in the country to which they have fled. We help these people relocate to a safe, new country, through resettlement or other pathways so that they can begin to rebuild their lives. RefugePoint helps refugees access these solutions using three tactics: direct services, field building, and systems change. Through this three-pronged approach we provide direct services to thousands of refugees each year, strengthen the capacity of other organizations to better serve refugees, and influence global policy and practice to transform refugee response systems.\nLasting solutions work. Directly, we\u2019ve referred over 140,000 refugees for resettlement or other pathways to a safe, third country.
